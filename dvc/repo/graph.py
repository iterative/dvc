    Edges are created when the output of one stage is used as a
    dependency in other stage.

    The direction of the edges goes from the stage to its dependency:

    For example, running the following:

        $ dvc run -o A "echo A > A"
        $ dvc run -d A -o B "echo B > B"
        $ dvc run -d B -o C "echo C > C"
